📝 Brief Description of Each Step:

Problem Statement: Define what the system is solving, objectives, and high-level goals.

SRS: A structured document detailing functional and non-functional requirements.

ER Diagram: Design of the database schema showing entities, attributes, and relationships.

DFD: Represents the flow of data through the system (typically Level 0, 1, 2 etc.).

Use Case Diagram: Shows system functionality from the user's perspective.

Sequence Diagram: Describes how objects interact over time to accomplish a function.

Collaboration Diagram: Shows interactions between objects focusing on their relationships.

Activity Diagram: Describes the workflow or business process in a step-by-step manner.



✅ ER Diagram Rules (Quick Summary)

Entities → Rectangles (nouns, e.g., Student).

Attributes → Ovals (properties of entities).

Simple, Composite, Derived, Multivalued

Relationships → Diamonds (verbs, e.g., enrolls in).



✅ Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Rules – Quick Summary

1. Four Main Components
Process → Rounded rectangles/circles (e.g., Validate Login)

Data Flow → Arrows showing movement of data

Data Store → Open-ended rectangles (e.g., User DB)

External Entity → Squares (e.g., Customer, Admin)



✅ Use Case Diagram Rules – Quick Summary

1. Main Elements
Actors → Stick figures (users or other systems interacting with the system).

Use Cases → Ovals (actions/functions the system performs).

System Boundary → Rectangle enclosing all use cases.

Relationships:

Association → Line connecting actor ↔ use case.

Include → Dashed arrow labeled <<include>> (reusable common steps).

Extend → Dashed arrow labeled <<extend>> (optional or conditional actions).

Generalization → Solid arrow with hollow triangle (actor or use case inheritance).



✅ Sequence Diagram Rules – Quick Summary

1. Main Elements
Objects/Actors → Rectangles at the top (with lifelines going down).

Lifelines → Dashed vertical lines showing the life of the object over time.

Messages → Arrows between lifelines (representing interactions).

Activation Bars → Thin rectangles on lifelines showing when an object is active.


✅ Collaboration Diagram Rules – Quick Summary

1. Main Elements
Objects/Actors → Boxes with object names (e.g., :Customer)

Links → Lines connecting objects (represent relationships/associations)

Messages → Numbered arrows along the links showing message flow and order


✅ Activity Diagram Rules – Quick Summary

1. Main Elements
Activities → Rounded rectangles (represent tasks or actions).

Transitions → Arrows showing the flow from one activity to another.

Start Node → Solid circle (indicates the beginning of the process).

End Node → Solid circle with a border (indicates the end of the process).

Decision Node → Diamond shape (used to show branching based on conditions).

Fork/Join Node → Horizontal or vertical bars (for parallel actions).

Swimlanes → Vertical or horizontal divisions to group activities by actor or component.
